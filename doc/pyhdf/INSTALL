Installing the pyhdf python package.

pyhdf has been successfully installed under python 2.2 and above on
the following platforms:
  -Linux, kernel 2.4.19 and above
  -Tru64 4.0.f and above
  -Solaris 8
  -AIX 4

Please inform the author (gosselina@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) of any
successfull installation on a different platform, and of
problems encountered.

To install, follow these steps.

1-Install the HDF4 library. Source code is available at:
  http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf4.html. Binary packages
  are available for most popular environments.
  Release 4.2r1 must be installed for pyhdf-0.7-3 to work.

  HDF4.2 in turn requires some libraries : libjpeg, libz, and libsz
  if the SZIP compression method is to be used.

2-Install the python Numeric package. Source code is
  available at: numpy.sourceforge.net. Binary packages
  are available for most popular environments.
  Note that version 22 or above is needed to compile
  support for unsigned integer types. See details inside
  `setup.py' if you want to use an earlier version of Numeric.

3-Uncompress and untar the pyhdf tar ball, then cd to the
  pyhdf-xxx directory just created.

4-If your HDF4 libraries or include files reside in directories
  that are not searched by default on your system,
  the installation script will complain about missing files.
  In that case, edit the `setup.py' file and locate the 
  lines reading:

    #include_dirs=["non standard path where hdf includes live"],
    #library_dirs=["non standard path where libs live"],

  Remove the pound sign to uncomment the line(s) to edit, and enter 
  the required paths in quotes between the square brackets. For ex.,
  if at your site HDF has been installed in directory
  "/usr/local/hdf-4.2r1", enter:

    include_dirs = ["/usr/local/hdf-4.2r1/include"]
    library_dirs = ["/usr/local/hdf-4.2r1/lib"],

  HDF4.2 no more provides its own copies of the jpeg and z libraries.
  Those must be installed separately (on Linux, they should be part of
  any standard distribution). The sz 2.0 library must be installed if the SZIP
  compression method is to be used, and HDF must have been compiled with
  SZIP support. Note that if you installed precompiled HDF binaries provided
  by NCSA, you *must* install SZIP in a separate step (see NCSA hdf site for
  details). In case your HDF library does not include SZIP support,
  set the following inside file 'setup.py' (see comments inside this file) :

    extra_compile_args=["-DNOSZIP"]
    libraries = ["mfhdf", "df", "jpeg", "z"]


  TRU64 note
    The HDF installation creates its libraries as archive (.a) files,
    not shareable (.so) ones. On TRU64, the linker by default first looks
    for shareable libraries in every directory, then in a second round
    for archive files. This means that if there is a libjpeg.so somewhere 
    on the standard linker search paths, it will be found first, even if 
    the HDF libjpeg.a file exists in the directory pointed by "library_dirs". 
    To solve the problem, edit the line:
   
      #extra_link_args=["extra stuff passed to the linker"],

    changing it to:

      extra_link_args = ["-oldstyle_liblookup"],

    This will tell the linker to look for .so then for .a files in each visited
    directory.


5-As root, execute the command:

      # python setup.py install

    As a precaution, you may want to first wipe out any previus pyhdf 
    installation, if any :

      # rm -rf <python-stdlib-path>/site-packages/pyhdf

    where <python-stdlib-path> stands for the python standard library path
    (on linux: /usr/lib/pythonx.x).

6- Before experimenting with pyhdf, exit root privileges and leave the installation directory
   (the one where you untarred the product). Failing to do so may cause all sorts
   of mysterious problems.

Enjoy!
