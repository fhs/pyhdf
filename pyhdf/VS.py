VS (Vdata table) API (:mod:`pyhdf.VS`)
======================================

A module of the pyhdf package implementing the VS (Vdata table)
API of the NCSA HDF4 library.

Introduction
------------
VS is one of the modules composing pyhdf, a python package implementing
the NCSA HDF library and letting one manage HDF files from within a python
program. Two versions of the HDF library currently exist, version 4 and
version 5. pyhdf only implements version 4 of the library. Many
different APIs are to be found inside the HDF4 specification.
Currently, pyhdf implements just a few of those: the SD, VS and V APIs.
Other APIs should be added in the future (GR, AN, etc).

VS allows the definition of structured data tables inside an HDF file.
Those tables are designated as "vdatas" (the name has to do with data
associated with the "vertices" of geometrical models, the storage of which
the API was originally designed for). A vdata is composed of a fixed
number of columns (also called fields), where a column can store a fixed
number of data values, all of the same type. The number of values allowed
inside a field is called the "order" of the field. A table is composed of a
varying number of rows (also called records), a record representing the
sequence of values stored in each field of the vdata.

A vdata is associated with a descriptive name, and likewise each field of
the vdata. A vdata can also be tagged with a "class" to further describe the
vdata purpose. Records and fields are identified by a zero-based index.
An arbitrary number of attributes of different types can be attached to
a vdata as a whole, or to its individual fields. An attribute is a
(name, value) pair, where "value" can be of many types, and be either
single or multi-valued. The number of values stored in an attribute is
called the "order" of the attribute.

The following example illustrates a simple vdata that could be stored
inside an HDF file. See section "Programming models" for an example
program implementing this vdata.

                             INVENTORY (experimental status)

            ======     ===========     ===   ========  ========
            partid     description     qty   wght(lb)  price($)
            ======     ===========     ===   ========  ========
            Q1234       bolt           12     0.01      0.05
            B5432       brush          10     0.4       4.25
            S7613       scissor         2     0.2       3.75
            ======     ===========     ===   ========  ========

The vdata is composed of 5 fields. 3 records are shown (of course, a vdata
can store much more than that). "INVENTORY" would be the vdata name, and
"partid", "description", etc, would be the field names. The data type varies
between fields. "partid" and "description" would be of "multicharacter" type
(aka "string"), "qty" would be a integer, and "wght" and "price" would be
floats. The text in parentheses could be stored as attributes. A "status"
attribute could be defined for the table as a whole, and given the
value "experimental". Likewise, a "unit" attribute could be associated
with fields "wght" and "price", and given the values "lb" and "$", resp.

The VS API allows one to create, locate and open a vdata inside an
HDF file, update and append records inside it, read records randomly
or sequentially, and access and update the vdata and field attributes.
Attributes can be read and written using the familiar python "dot
notation", and records can be read and written by indexing and slicing the
vdata as if it were a python sequence.

VS module key features
----------------------
VS key features are as follows.

- pyhdf implements almost every routine of the original VS API.
  Only a few have been ignored, most of them being of a rare use:

  - VSgetblocksize() / VSsetblocksize()
  - VSsetnumblocks()
  - VSlone

- It is quite straightforward to go from a C version to a python version
  of a program accessing the VS API, and to learn VS usage by refering to
  the C API documentation.

- A few high-level python methods have been developped to ease
  programmers task. Of greatest interest are the following:

  - Access to attributes through the familiar "dot notation".
  - Indexing and slicing a vdata to read and write its records,
    similarly to a python sequence.
  - Easy retrieval of info on a vdata and its fields.
  - Easy creation of vdatas.

Accessing the VS module
-----------------------
To access the VS module a python program can say one of:

  >>> import pyhdf.VS        # must prefix names with "pyhdf.VS."
  >>> from pyhdf import VS   # must prefix names with "VS."
  >>> from pyhdf.VS import * # names need no prefix

This document assumes the last import style is used.

VS is not self-contained, and needs functionnality provided by another
pyhdf module, namely the HDF module. This module must thus be imported
also:

  >>> from .HDF import *

Package components
------------------
pyhdf is a proper Python package, eg a collection of modules stored under
a directory whose name is that of the package and which stores an
__init__.py file. Following the normal installation procedure, this
directory will be <python-lib>/site-packages/pyhdf', where <python-lib>
stands for the python installation directory.

For each HDF API exists a corresponding set of modules.

The following modules are related to the VS API.

  _hdfext
    C extension module responsible for wrapping the HDF
    C library for all python modules
  hdfext
    python module implementing some utility functions
    complementing the _hdfext extension module
  error
    defines the HDF4Error exception
  HDF
    python module providing support to the VS module
  VS
    python module wrapping the VS API routines inside
    an OOP framework

_hdfext and hdfext were generated using the SWIG preprocessor.
SWIG is however *not* needed to run the package. Those two modules
are meant to do their work in the background, and should never be called
directly. Only HDF and VS should be imported by the user program.

Prerequisites
-------------
The following software must be installed in order for VS to
work.

  HDF (v4) library
    pyhdf does *not* include the HDF4 library, which must
    be installed separately.

    HDF is available at:
    "https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Download+HDF4".

Numeric is also needed by the SD module. See the SD module documentation.

Documentation
-------------
pyhdf has been written so as to stick as closely as possible to
the naming conventions and calling sequences documented inside the
"HDF User s Guide" manual. Even if pyhdf gives an OOP twist
to the C API, the manual can be easily used as a documentary source
for pyhdf, once the class to which a function belongs has been
identified, and of course once requirements imposed by the Python
langage have been taken into account. Consequently, this documentation
will not attempt to provide an exhaustive coverage of the HDF VS
API. For this, the user is referred to the above manual.
The documentation of each pyhdf method will indicate the name
of the equivalent routine as it is found inside the C API.

This document (in both its text and html versions) has been completely
produced using "pydoc", the Python documentation generator (which
made its debut in the 2.1 Python release). pydoc can also be used
as an on-line help tool. For example, to know everything about
the VS.VD class, say:

  >>> from pydoc import help
  >>> from pyhdf.VS import *
  >>> help(VD)

To be more specific and get help only for the read() method of the
VD class:

  >>> help(VD.read)

pydoc can also be called from the command line, as in::

  % pydoc pyhdf.VS.VD         # doc for the whole VD class
  % pydoc pyhdf.VS.VD.read    # doc for the VD.read method

Summary of differences between the pyhdf and C VS API
-----------------------------------------------------
Most of the differences between the pyhdf and C VS API can
be summarized as follows.

- In the C API, every function returns an integer status code, and values
  computed by the function are returned through one or more pointers
  passed as arguments.
- In pyhdf, error statuses are returned through the Python exception
  mechanism, and values are returned as the method result. When the
  C API specifies that multiple values are returned, pyhdf returns a
  sequence of values, which are ordered similarly to the pointers in the
  C function argument list.

Error handling
--------------
All errors reported by the C VS API with a SUCCESS/FAIL error code
are reported by pyhdf using the Python exception mechanism.
When the C library reports a FAIL status, pyhdf raises an HDF4Error
exception (a subclass of Exception) with a descriptive message.
Unfortunately, the C library is rarely informative about the cause of
the error. pyhdf does its best to try to document the error, but most
of the time cannot do more than saying "execution error".

VS needs support from the HDF module
------------------------------------
The VS module is not self-contained (countrary to the SD module).
It requires help from the HDF module, namely:

- the HDF.HDF class to open and close the HDF file, and initialize the
  VS interface
- the HDF.HC class to provide different sorts of constants (opening modes,
  data types, etc).

A program wanting to access HDF vdatas will almost always need to execute
the following minimal set of calls:

  >>> from pyhdf.HDF import *
  >>> from pyhdf.VS import *
  >>> hdfFile = HDF(name, HC.xxx)# open HDF file
  >>> vs = hdfFile.vstart()      # initialize VS interface on HDF file
  >>> ...                        # manipulate vdatas through "vs"
  >>> vs.end()                   # terminate VS interface
  >>> hdfFile.close()            # close HDF file

Classes summary
---------------
pyhdf wraps the VS API using different python classes::

  VS      HDF VS interface
  VD      vdata
  VDField vdata field
  VDattr  attribute (either at the vdata or field level)

In more detail::

  VS     The VS class implements the VS (Vdata) interface applied to an
         HDF file. This class encapsulates the hdf instance, and all
         the top-level functions of the VS API.

         To create a VS instance, call the vstart() method of an
         HDF instance.

         methods:
           constructors:
             attach()       open an existing vdata given its name or
                            reference number, or create a new one,
                            returning a VD instance
             create()       create a new vdata and define its structure,
                            returning a VD instance

           creating and initializing a simple vdata
             storedata()    create a single-field vdata and initialize
                            its values

           closing the interface
             end()          close the VS interface on the HDF file

           searching
             find()         get a vdata reference number given its name
             next()         get the reference number of the vdata following
                            a given one

           inquiry
             vdatainfo()    return info about all the vdatas in the
                            HDF file

  VD     The VD class describes a vdata. It encapsulates
         the VS instance to which the vdata belongs, and the vdata
         identifier.

         To instantiate a VD class, call the attach() or create()
         method of a VS class instance.

         methods:
           constructors
             attr()         create a VDAttr instance representing a
                            vdata attribute; "dot notation" can also be
                            used to access a vdata attribute
             field()        return a VDField instance representing a given
                            field of the vdata

           closing vdata
             detach()       end access to the vdata

           defining fields
             fdefine()      define the name, type and order of a new field
             setfields()    define the field names and field order for
                            the read() and write() methods; also used to
                            initialize the structure of a vdata previously
                            created with the VS.attach() method

           reading and writing
                            note: a vdata can be indexed and sliced like a
                            python sequence

             read()         return the values of a number of records
                            starting at the current record position
             seek()         reset the current record position
             seekend()      seek past the last record
             tell()         return the current record position
             write()        write a number of records starting at the
                            current record position

           inquiry
             attrinfo()     return info about all the vdata attributes
             fexist()       check if a vdata contains a given set of fields
             fieldinfo()    return info about all the vdata fields
             findattr()     locate an attribute, returning a VDAttr instance
                            if found
             inquire()      return info about the vdata
             sizeof()       return the size in bytes of one or more fields

  VDField  The VDField class represents a vdata field. It encapsulates
           the VD instance to which the field belongs, and the field
           index number.

           To instantiate a VDField, call the field() method of a VD class
           instance.

           methods:
             constructors:
               attr()       return a VDAttr instance representing an
                            attribute of the field; "dot notation"
                            can also be used to get/set an attribute.

             inquiry
               attrinfo()   return info about all the field attributes
               find()       locate an attribute, returning a VDAttr
                            instance if found

  VDAttr   The VDAttr class encapsulates methods used to set and query
           attributes defined at the level either of the vdata or the
           vdata field.

           To create an instance of this class, call the attr() or
           findattr() methods of a VD instance (for vdata attributes),
           or call the attr() or find() methods of a VDField instance
           (for field attributes).

           methods:
             get / set
               get()        get the attribute value
               set()        set the attribute value

             info
               info()       retrieve info about the attribute

Data types
----------
Data types come into play when first defining vdata fields and attributes,
and later when querying the definition of those fields and attributes.
Data types are specified using the symbolic constants defined inside the
HC class of the HDF module.

- CHAR and CHAR8 (equivalent): an 8-bit character.
- UCHAR, UCHAR8 and UINT8 (equivalent): unsigned 8-bit values (0 to 255)
- INT8:    signed 8-bit values (-128 to 127)
- INT16:   signed 16-bit values
- UINT16:  unsigned 16 bit values
- INT32:   signed 32 bit values
- UINT32:  unsigned 32 bit values
- FLOAT32: 32 bit floating point values (C floats)
- FLOAT64: 64 bit floating point values (C doubles)

There is no explicit "string" type. To simulate a string, set the field or
attribute type to CHAR, and set the field or attribute "order" to
a value of 'n' > 1. This creates and "array of characters", close
to a string (except that strings will always be of length 'n', right-padded
with spaces if necessary).

Attribute access: low and high level
------------------------------------
The VS API allow setting attributes on vdatas and vdata fields. Attributes
can be of many types (int, float, char) of different bit lengths (8, 16, 32,
64 bits), and can be single or multi-valued. Values of a multi-valued
attribute must all be of the same type.

Attributes can be set and queried in two different ways. First, given a
VD instance (describing a vdata object) or a VDField instance (describing a
vdata field), the attr() method of that instance is called to create a
VDAttr instance representing the wanted attribute (possibly non existent).
The set() method of this VDAttr instance is then called to define the
attribute value, creating it if it does not already exist. The get() method
returns the current attribute value. Here is an example.

  >>> from pyhdf.HDF import *
  >>> from pyhdf.VS import *
  >>> f = HDF('test.hdf', HC.WRITE) # Open file 'test.hdf' in write mode
  >>> vs = f.vstart()            # init vdata interface
  >>> vd = vs.attach('vtest', 1) # attach vdata 'vtest' in write mode
  >>> attr = vd.attr('version')  # prepare to define the 'version' attribute
                                 # on the vdata
  >>> attr.set(HC.CHAR8,'1.0')   # set attribute 'version' to string '1.0'
  >>> print(attr.get())           # get and print attribute value
  >>> fld  = vd.field('fld1')    # obtain a field instance for field 'fld1'
  >>> attr = fld.attr('range')   # prepare to define attribute 'range' on
                                 # this field
  >>> attr.set(HC.INT32,(-10, 15)) # set attribute 'range' to a pair of ints
  >>> print(attr.get())             # get and print attribute value

  >>> vd.detach()                # "close" the vdata
  >>> vs.end()                   # terminate the vdata interface
  >>> f.close()                  # close the HDF file

The second way consists of setting/querying an attribute as if it were a
normal python class attribute, using the usual dot notation. Above example
then becomes:

  >>> from pyhdf.HDF import *
  >>> from pyhdf.VS import *
  >>> f = HDF('test.hdf', HC.WRITE) # Open file 'test.hdf' in write mode
  >>> vs = f.vstart()            # init vdata interface
  >>> vd = vs.attach('vtest', 1) # attach vdata 'vtest' in write mode
  >>> vd.version = '1.0'         # create vdata attribute 'version',
                                 # setting it to string '1.0'
  >>> print(vd.version)           # print attribute value
  >>> fld  = vd.field('fld1')    # obtain a field instance for field 'fld1'
  >>> fld.range = (-10, 15)      # create field attribute 'range', setting
                                 # it to the pair of ints (-10, 15)
  >>> print(fld.range)            # print attribute value
  >>> vd.detach()                # "close" the vdata
  >>> vs.end()                   # terminate the vdata interface
  >>> f.close()                  # close the HDF file

Note how the dot notation greatly simplifies and clarifies the code.
Some latitude is however lost by manipulating attributes in that way,
because the pyhdf package, not the programmer, is then responsible of
setting the attribute type. The attribute type is chosen to be one of:

  =========== ====================================
  HC.CHAR8    if the attribute value is a string
  HC.INT32    if all attribute values are integers
  HC.FLOAT64  otherwise
  =========== ====================================

The first way of handling attribute values must be used if one wants to
define an attribute of any other type (for ex. 8 or 16 bit integers,
signed or unsigned). Also, only a VDAttr instance gives access to attribute
info, through its info() method.

However, accessing HDF attributes as if they were python attributes raises
an important issue. There must exist a way to assign generic attributes
to the python objects without requiring those attributes to be converted
to HDF attributes. pyhdf uses the following rule: an attribute whose name
starts with an underscore ('_') is either a "predefined" attribute
(see below) or a standard python attribute. Otherwise, the attribute
is handled as an HDF attribute. Also, HDF attributes are not stored inside
the object dictionnary: the python dir() function will not list them.

Attribute values can be updated, but it is illegal to try to change the
value type, or the attribute order (number of values). This is important
for attributes holding string values. An attribute initialized with an
'n' character string is simply a character attribute of order 'n' (eg a
character array of length 'n'). If 'vd' is a vdata and we initialize its
'a1' attribute as 'vd.a1 = "abcdef"', then a subsequent update attempt
like 'vd.a1 = "12"' will fail, because we then try to change the order
of the attribute (from 6 to 2). It is mandatory to keep the length of string
attributes constant. Examples below show simple ways how this can be done.

Predefined attributes
---------------------
The VD and VDField classes support predefined attributes to get (and
occasionnaly set) attribute values easily, without having to call a
class method. The names of predefined attributes all start with an
underscore ('_').

In the following tables, the RW column holds an X if the attribute
is read/write. See the HDF User s guide for details about more
"exotic" topics like "class", "faked vdata" and "tag".

Record access: low and high level
---------------------------------
vdata records can be read and written in two different ways. The first one
consists of calling the basic I/O methods of the vdata:

- seek() to set the current record position, if necessary;
- read() to retrieve a given number of records from that position;
- write() to write a given number of records starting at
  that position

A second, higher level way, lets one see a vdata similarly to a python
sequence, and access its contents using the familiar indexing and slicing
notation in square brackets. Reading and writing a vdata as if it were a
python sequence may often look simpler, and improve code legibility.

Here are some examples of how a vdata 'vd' holding 3 fields could be read.

  >>> print(vd[0])         # print record 0
  >>> print(vd[-1])        # print last record
  >>> print(vd[2:])        # print records 2 and those that follow
  >>> print(vd[:])         # print all records
  >>> print(vd[:,0])       # print field 0 of all records
  >>> print(vd[:3,:2])     # print first 2 fields of first 3 records

As the above examples show, the usual python rules are obeyed regarding
the interpretation of indexing and slicing values. Note that the vdata
fields can be indexed and sliced, not only the records. The setfields()
method can also be used to select a subset to the vdata fields
(setfields() also let you reorder the fields). When the vdata is
indexed (as opposed to being sliced), a single record is returned as a list
of values. When the vdata is sliced, a list of records is
always returned (thus a 2-level list), even if the slice contains only
one record.

A vdata can also be written similarly to a python sequence. When indexing
the vdata (as opposed to slicing it), a single record must be assigned,
and the record must be given as a sequence of values. It is legal to use
as an index the current number of records in the vdata: the record is then
appended to the vdata. When slicing the vdata, the records assigned to the
slice must always be given as a list of records, even
if only one record is assigned. Also, the number of records assigned must
always match the width of the slice, except if the slice includes or goes
past the last record of the vdata. In that case, the number of records
assigned can exceed the width of the slice, and the extra records are
appended to the vdata. So, to append records to vdata 'vd', simply
assign records to the slice 'vd[vd._nrecs:]'. Note that, even if the
'field' dimension can be specified in the left-hand side expression,
there is no real interest in doing so, since all fields must
be specified when assigning a record to the vdata: it is an error to
try to assign just a few of the fields.

For example, given a vdata 'vd' holding 5 records, and lists 'reca',
'recb', etc, holding record values::

        vd[0] = reca              # updates record 0
        vd[0,:] = reca            # specifying fields is OK, but useless
        vd[0,1:] = reca[1:]       # error: all fields must be assigned
        vd[1] = [recb, recc]      # error: only one record allowed
        vd[5] = recc              # append one record
        vd[1:3] = [reca,recb]     # updates second and third record
        vd[1:4] = [reca, recb]    # error: 3 records needed
        vd[5:] = [reca,recb]      # appends 2 records to the vdata
        vd[4:] = [reca, recb]     # updates last record, append one



Programming models
------------------

Creating and initializing a new vdata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following code can serve as a model for the creation and
initialization of a new vdata. It implements the INVENTORY example
described in the "Introduction" section::

    from pyhdf.HDF import *
    from pyhdf.VS import *

    # Open HDF file and initialize the VS interface
    f = HDF('inventory.hdf',    # Open file 'inventory.hdf' in write mode
            HC.WRITE|HC.CREATE) # creating it if it does not exist
    vs = f.vstart()             # init vdata interface

    # Create vdata and define its structure
    vd = vs.create(             # create a new vdata
                   'INVENTORY', # name of the vdata
                                # fields of the vdata follow
               (('partid',HC.CHAR8, 5),       # 5 char string
                ('description',HC.CHAR8, 10), # 10 char string field
                ('qty',HC.INT16, 1),          # 1 16 bit int field
                ('wght',HC.FLOAT32, 1),       # 1 32 bit float
                ('price',HC.FLOAT32,1)        # 1 32 bit float
               ))         # 5 fields allocated in the vdata

    # Set attributes on the vdata and its fields
    vd.field('wght').unit = 'lb'
    vd.field('price').unit = '$'
    # In order to be able to update a string attribute, it must
    # always be set to the same length. This sets 'status' to a 20
    # char long, left-justified string, padded with spaces on the right.
    vd.status = "%-20s" % 'phase 1 done'

    # Store records
    vd.write((                # write 3 records
              ('Q1234', 'bolt',12, 0.01, 0.05),   # record 1
              ('B5432', 'brush', 10, 0.4, 4.25),  # record 2
              ('S7613', 'scissor', 2, 0.2, 3.75)  # record 3
              ))
    vd.detach()               # "close" the vdata

    vs.end()                  # terminate the vdata interface
    f.close()                 # close the HDF file


Note that is mandatory to always write whole records to the vdata.
Note also the comments about the initialization of the 'status'
vdata attribute. We want to be able update this attribute (see
following examples). However, the VS API  prohibits changing an attribute
type when updating its value. Since the length (order) of an attribute
is part of its type, we make sure of setting the attribute to a length
long enough to accomodate the longest possible string we migh want to
assign to the attribute.

Appending records to a vdata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Appending records requires first seeking to the end of the vdata, to avoid
overwriting existing records. The following code can serve as a model. The
INVENTORY vdata created before is used::

    from pyhdf.HDF import *
    from pyhdf.VS import *

    f = HDF('inventory.hdf',         # Open 'inventory.hdf' in write mode
            HC.WRITE|HC.CREATE)      # creating it if it does not exist
    vs = f.vstart()                  # init vdata interface
    vd = vs.attach('INVENTORY', 1)   # attach 'INVENTORY' in write mode

    # Update the `status' vdata attribute. The attribute length must not
    # change. We call the attribute info() method, which returns a list
    # where number of values (eg string length) is stored at index 2.
    # We then assign a left justified string of exactly that length.
    len = vd.attr('status').info()[2]
    vd.status = '%-*s' % (len, 'phase 2 done')

    vd[vd._nrecs:] = (                     # append 2 records
          ('A4321', 'axe', 5, 1.5, 25),    # first record
          ('C3214', 'cup', 100, 0.1, 3.25) # second record
                    )
    vd.detach()               # "close" the vdata

    vs.end()                  # terminate the vdata interface
    f.close()                 # close the HDF file

Note how, when updating the value of the 'status' vdata attribute,
we take care of assigning a value of the same length as that of the
original value. Otherwise, the assignment would raise an exception.
Records are written by assigning the vdata through a slicing
expression, like a python sequence. By specifying the number of records
as the start of the slice, the records are appended to the vdata.

Updating records in a vdata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Updating requires seeking to the record to update before writing the new
records. New data will overwrite this record and all records that follow,
until a new seek is performed or the vdata is closed. Note that record
numbering starts at 0.

The following code can serve as a model. The INVENTORY vdata created
before is used::

    from pyhdf.HDF import *
    from pyhdf.VS import *

    f = HDF('inventory.hdf',         # Open 'inventory.hdf' in write mode
            HC.WRITE|HC.CREATE)      # creating it if it does not exist
    vs = f.vstart()                  # init vdata interface
    vd = vs.attach('INVENTORY', 1)   # attach 'INVENTORY' in write mode

    # Update the `status' vdata attribute. The attribute length must not
    # change. We call the attribute info() method, which returns a list
    # where number of values (eg string length) is stored at index 2.
    # We then assign a left justified string of exactly that length.
    len = vd.attr('status').info()[2]
    vd.status = '%-*s' % (len, 'phase 3 done')

    # Update record at index 1 (second record)
    vd[1]  = ('Z4367', 'surprise', 10, 3.1, 44.5)
    # Update record at index 4, and all those that follow
    vd[4:] = (
              ('QR231', 'toy', 12, 2.5, 45),
              ('R3389', 'robot', 3, 45, 2000)
              )
    vd.detach()               # "close" the vdata
    vs.end()                  # terminate the vdata interface
    f.close()                 # close the HDF file

Reading a vdata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following example shows how read the vdata attributes and sequentially
maneuver through its records. Note how we use the exception mechanism
to break out of the reading loop when we reach the end of the vdata::

    from pyhdf.HDF import *
    from pyhdf.VS import *

    f = HDF('inventory.hdf')         # open 'inventory.hdf' in read mode
    vs = f.vstart()                  # init vdata interface
    vd = vs.attach('INVENTORY')      # attach 'INVENTORY' in read mode

    # Display some vdata attributes
    print "status:", vd.status
    print "vdata: ", vd._name        # predefined attribute: vdata name
    print "nrecs: ", vd._nrecs       # predefined attribute:  num records

    # Display value of attribute 'unit' for all fields on which
    # this attribute is set
    print "units: ",
    for fieldName in vd._fields:     # loop over all field names
        try:
            # instantiate field and obtain value of attribute 'unit'
            v = vd.field(fieldName).unit
            print "%s: %s" % (fieldName, v),
        except:                      # no 'unit' attribute: ignore
            pass
    print ""
    print ""

    # Display table header.
    header = "%-7s %-12s %3s %4s %8s" % tuple(vd._fields)
    print "-" * len(header)
    print header
    print "-" * len(header)

    # Loop over the vdata records, displaying each record as a table row.
    # Current record position is 0 after attaching the vdata.
    while 1:
        try:
            rec = vd.read()       # read next record
            # equivalent to:
          # rec = vd[vd.tell()]
            print "%-7s %-12s %3d %4.1f %8.2f" % tuple(rec[0])
        except HDF4Error:             # end of vdata reached
            break

    vd.detach()               # "close" the vdata
    vs.end()                  # terminate the vdata interface
    f.close()                 # close the HDF file

In the previous example, the reading/displaying loop can be greatly
simplified by rewriting it as follows::

    from pyhdf.HDF import *
    from pyhdf.VS import *

    f = HDF('inventory.hdf')         # open 'inventory.hdf' in read mode
    vs = f.vstart()                  # init vdata interface
    vd = vs.attach('INVENTORY')      # attach 'INVENTORY' in read mode

    ....

    # Read all records at once, and loop over the sequence.
    for rec in vd[:]:
        print "%-7s %-12s %3d %4.1f %8.2f" % tuple(rec)

    vd.detach()               # "close" the vdata
    ...

The indexing expression 'vd[:]' returns the complete set of records,
which can then be looped over using a 'for' statement. This style of loop
is quite clean, and should look very familiar to python adepts.

        setfields() indicates how to perform the matching between the vdata
        fields and the values passed to the write() method or returned
        by the read() method.

        For example, if the vdata contains fields 'a', 'b' and 'c' and
        a "setfields('c','a')" call is made,  read() will thereafter return
        for each record the values of field 'c' and 'a', in that order.
        Field 'b' will be ignored.

        When writing to a vdata, setfields() has a second usage. It is used
        to initialize the structure of the vdata, that is, the name and order
        of the fields that it will contain. The fields must have been
        previously defined by calls to the fdefine() method.
        Following that first call, setfields() can be called again to
        change the order in which the record values will be passed
        to the write() method. However, since it is mandatory to write
        whole records, subsequent calls to setfields() must specify every
        field name: only the field order can be changed.
